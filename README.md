# Pacman Wars

Pacman Wars is a group project made for game dev class.

The game is based on the original Pacman game, but introduces a second player. The main goal of the game is to catch as many points as possible to defeat the opponent player.

This game was proudly made using [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame).

# Controls

Player 1 moves using <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> keys and player 2 using <kbd>Up</kbd> <kbd>Left</kbd> <kbd>Down</kbd> <kbd>Right</kbd> keys.

# Mechanics

As this game is based on the original Pacman a lot of mechanics are ported to our version with the introduction of some extra ones:

- A player wins when the opponent player runs out of lives;
- A player can beat the high score, but it is only valid if the player wins the game.
